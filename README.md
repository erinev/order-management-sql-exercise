# Time for solution

Take as long as you need on the solution but we suggest to limit yourself at 8 hours. Do let us know how much time it took you!

The task is not made to be completed in the period of 8 hours and no one expects you to! However, knowing how much time you spent and seeing the solution you came up with allows for seeing what you prioritize and where you would consider cutting corners on a sharp deadline.
